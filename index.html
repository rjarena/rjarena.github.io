    <h2>Need for Speed -- Planes, Trains, and Automobiles</h2>
    <p>I have been fascinated by speed since childhood.  Always had a fast bike. Played baseball and had an impressive fast ball.  Loved to write fast code on IBM System 360/370 Mainframes and have always been enthralled by the quickness of supercomputers.</p>
    <p>Even as an adult, I continue to look for fast toys.  Two of my favorites are pictured below.  The first is a Porsche 911, the best car I have ever owned. Quick off the mark, high top-end speed, corners likes it's on rails. A true joy to drive - but just not practical in snow and rain, things that occur far too often in the Northeast.  Quel dommage!  Just below it is the F-22 Raptor, a state-of-the-art, stealth, air-superiority fighter jet. Never had the opportunity to fly in one of these machines, but it is on the bucket list - not that I give it much chance of occurring.</p>

    <p>Still have one A-priority speed item -- High Speed Rail (HSR).  HSR provides 220+ mph top speed, 160 mph average speed.  It is time and cost competitive with air travel in distances between 200 and 600 miles.  Two HSR tracks provide the same passenger capacity as 16 lanes of an interstate highway. I have been fortunate enough to have ridden HSR in Europe and Asia.  Sad fact is that the rest of the civilized world has HSR -- it is long past time for America to get with the program.</p>

    <h3>Existing Website Analysis</h3>
    <p>Requirement is to inspect a comparative web site. Let's look at the Porsche site.</p>

    <p>The Porsche website is quite complicated.  There are multiple sites under the base home page to market its automobiles in multiple world markets, so there are several child index.html files.  The site also checks for older browsers and hides JavaScript commands from them.  There is an interesting section on social media tracking to keep tabs on site visitors. There are lines and lines of compact, virtually unreadable HTML code at the end that looks to have been created by a content management system (CMS)like WordPress.</p>
